	<P>
     Paragraphs are medium-sized units of writing, longer than sentences, but shorter than sections, chapters, or entire works. Because they connect the “small” ideas of individual sentences to a “bigger” idea, paragraph structure is essential to any writing for organization, flow, and comprehension.

Below we explain everything you need to know about paragraph structure to write like an expert, including several paragraph examples.
